// This has to be a root because once the msgCompose has deferred the treatment

//  nsMsgCopySendListener (nsMsgCompose.cpp). nsMsgCopySendListener holds a
//  *weak* reference to its corresponding nsIMsgCompose object, that in turns
//  forwards the notifications to our own little progressListener.
// So if no one holds a firm reference to gMsgCompose, then it might end up
//  being collected before the send process terminates, and then, it's BAD.
// The bad case would be:
//  * user hits "send"
//  * quickly changes conversations
//  * writes a new email
//  * the previous send hasn't completed, but the user hits send anyway
//  * gMsgCompose is overridden
//  * a garbage collection kicks in, collects the previous StateListener
//  * first send completes
//  * the first listener fails to receive the notification.
// That's way too implausible, so I'll just assume this doesn't happen!

/**
 * This is our monstrous Javascript function for sending a message. It hides all

 *  provides what I hope is a much more understandable interface.
 * You are expected to provide the whole set of listeners. The most interesting
 *  one is the stateListener, since it has the ComposeProcessDone notification.
 * This version only does plaintext composition but I hope to enhance it with
 *  both HTML and plaintext in the future.
 * @param composeParameters
 * @param composeParameters.identity The identity the user picked to send the
 *  message
 * @param composeParameters.to The recipients. This is a comma-separated list of
 *  valid email addresses that must be escaped already. You probably want to use
 *  nsIMsgHeaderParser.MakeFullAddress to deal with names that contain commas.
 * @param composeParameters.cc (optional) Same remark.
 * @param composeParameters.bcc (optional) Same remark.
 * @param composeParameters.subject The subject, no restrictions on that one.
 * @param composeParameters.returnReceipt (optional)
 * @param composeParameters.receiptType (optional)
 * @param composeParameters.requestDsn (optional)
 *
 * @param sendingParameters
 * @param sendingParameters.deliverType See Ci.nsIMsgCompDeliverMode
 * @param sendingParameters.compType See Ci.nsIMsgCompType. We use this to
 *  determine what kind of headers we should set (Reply-To, References...).
 *
 * @param aNode The DOM node that holds the editing session. Right now, it's
 *  kinda useless if it's only plaintext, but it's relevant for the HTML
 *  composition (because nsMsgSend queries the original DOM node to find out
 *  about inline images).
 *
 * @param listeners
 * @param listeners.progressListener That one monitors the progress of long
 *  operations (like sending a message with attachments), it's notified with the
 *  current percentage of completion.
 * @param listeners.sendListener That one receives notifications about factual
 *  events (sending, copying to Sent, ...). It receives notifications with
 *  statuses.
 * @param listeners.stateListener This one is a high-level listener that
 *   receives notifications about the global composition process.
 *
 * @param options
 * @param options.popOut Don't send the message, just transfer it to a new
 *  composition window.
 * @param options.archive Shall we archive the message right away? This won't
 *  even copy it to the Sent folder. Warning: this one assumes that the "right"
 *  Archives folder already exists.
